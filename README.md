        Nelly Cheboi, a Kenyan, left her prestigious role as a software engineer in Chicago
         in 2019 to establish computer labs for school children in Kenya. Her efforts through 
         the non-profit organization TechLit Africa have provided numerous students in rural 
         areas of Kenya with access to repurposed computers.
